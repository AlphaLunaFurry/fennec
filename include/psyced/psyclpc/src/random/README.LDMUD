This is SFMT-1.3.3, stripped down to what is required by the LDMud gamedriver.

Additionally the 'public' function were made static as well because they are
probably not used without the wrapper. Therefore, their declarations have been
commented out.
The small inline functions from SFMT.h were moved to SFMT.c for the same
reason.

The files README.txt and LICENSE.txt tell you where to get the complete package.
