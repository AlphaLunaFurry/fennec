 * Dynamic data structures used to annotate objects.
 *
 *---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This include file defines two types of annotation structures: actions
 * and shadow structures. A third type, interactive structures, which are
 * a special case of shadow structures, is defined in comm.h. All annotations
 * structures are derived from the same sentence base structure.
 *
 * Sentences annotate an object with information about actions (verbs
 * and functions), and shadows, and network connection data ('interactive
 * sentences'). In fact, the shadow sentence serves as anchor point for
 * all annotations but actions.
 *
 * The sentences are kept in a single-linked list, originating at
 * object->sent. Within this list, there can be only one shadow
 * sentence, and it is always placed at the head of the list. This very
 * instance forms the head of an independent double-linked list should there
 * be more than one shadow for the object.
 *
 * The different types of sentences are distinguished by their '.type'
 * member. The following types are defined:
 *
 *    SENT_PLAIN, SENT_SHORT_VERB, SENT_NO_SPACE
 *        The sentence is of type 'action_t' and holds information
 *        about an action (verb + function) available to one object.
 *
 *    SENT_MARKER
 *        A special case of 'action_t' sentence which is used to
 *        control the search for a command.
 *
 *    SENT_SHADOW:
 *        The sentence is of type 'shadow_sentence' and describes
 *        an object shadow. It also holds the ed_buffer_t* for
 *        objects using the editor.
