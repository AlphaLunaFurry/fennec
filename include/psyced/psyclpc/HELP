[HISTORY]
psyclpc is a programming language for intense multi-user network applications
such as psyced. it's a recent fork of LDMud with some features and many
bug fixes. we kept it compatible to LDMud, so you can run a MUD with it, too.
It is available from <http://lpc.psyc.eu>.

LDMud itself is a continuation of the Amylaar LPMud Gamedriver 3.1.2.
