This directory holds a LPC object which runs a stress test against the driver:
it calls random efuns with random arguments and keeps a log of what has been
called.

It was written for the Unitopia mudlib (and thusly uses some of their
simul-efuns). To use it, copy secure.inc into the secure/simul_efun
directory first.

  crasher.c  : the test object
  crashleak.c: a variant of the crasher object looking for memory leaks.
  secure.inc : a replacement for the original secure/simul_efun/secure.inc,
               so that the security-sensitive functions can be tested, too.
