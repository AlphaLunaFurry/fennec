Options are:
.HP
\fB\-\-args\fR <filename>

commandline.
.HP
\fB\-P\fR|\-\-inherit <fd\-number>
.IP
Inherit filedescriptor <fd\-number> from the parent process
as socket to listen for connections.
.HP
\fB\-u\fR|\-\-udp <portnumber>
.IP
Specify the <portnumber> for the UDP port, overriding the compiled\-in
default.
.HP
\fB\-D\fR|\-\-define <macro>[=<text>]
.IP
Add <macro> (optionally to be expanded to <text>) to the list of
predefined macros known by the LPC compiler.
.HP
\fB\-E\fR|\-\-eval\-cost <ticks>
.IP

.HP
\fB\-M\fR|\-\-master <filename>
.IP
Use <filename> for the master object.
.HP
\fB\-m\fR|\-\-mudlib <pathname>
.IP
Use <pathname> as the top directory of the library.
.HP
\fB\-\-debug\-file\fR <filename>
.IP
This function has been disabled at compile time.
Please remove it from your scripts.
.HP
\fB\-\-hostname\fR <name>
.IP
Use <name> as hostname, instead of what the system says.
.HP
\fB\-\-hostaddr\fR <addr>
.IP
Use <addr> as address of this machine, instead of what the
system says. In particular this address will be used to open
the driver ports.
.HP
\fB\-\-compat\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-compat\fR
.IP
Select the mode (compat or plain) of the driver.
Note that this choice does not affect the default name of the master
object.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR|\-\-debug
.IP
Generate debug output; repeat the argument for even more output.
.HP
\fB\-c\fR|\-\-list\-compiles
.IP
List the name of every compiled file on stderr.
.HP
\fB\-e\fR|\-\-no\-preload
.IP
Pass a non\-zero argument (the number of occurences of this option)
to master\->preload(), which usually inhibits all preloads of castles
and other objects.
.HP
\fB\-\-erq\fR <filename>
.HP
\fB\-\-erq\fR "<filename> <erq arguments>"
.IP
Use <filename> instead of 'erq' as the name of the ERQ executable.
If the name starts with a '/', it is take to be an absolute pathname,
otherwise it is interpreted relative to /opt/psyced/bin.
If not specified, 'erq' is used as executable name.
With the proper use of quotes it is legal to pass arbitrary arguments
to the erq, however, these may not contain spaces themselves.
.HP
\fB\-N\fR|\-\-no\-erq
.IP
Don't start the erq demon (if it would be started at all).
.HP

\fB\-\-sync\-heart\fR
.IP
All heartbeats are executed at the same time (modulo granularity).
.HP
\fB\-\-async\-heart\fR
.IP
Heartbeats are executed immediately when they are due (modulo granularity).
.HP
\fB\-t\fR|\-\-no\-heart
.IP
Disable heartbeats and call_outs.
.HP
\fB\-f\fR|\-\-funcall <word>

gamedriver accepts network connections.
.HP
\fB\-\-cleanup\-time\fR <time>
.IP

clean it up. This time should be substantially higher than the
reset time. A time <= 0 disables the cleanup mechanism.
.HP
\fB\-\-reset\-time\fR <time>

The time in seconds for an object before it is reset.
A time <= 0 disables the reset mechanism.

thread.

.SH HISTORY
psyclpc is a programming language for intense multi-user network applications
such as psyced. it's a recent fork of LDMud with some features and many
bug fixes. we kept it compatible to LDMud, so you can run a MUD with it, too.
It is available from <http://lpc.psyc.eu>.

LDMud itself is a continuation of the Amylaar LPMud Gamedriver 3.1.2.
See also <http://www.bearnip.com/lars/proj/ldmud.html>.

psyclpc is released under the GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 2.
