First Steps with your new psyced

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We're even more proud to see that now you have installed a psyced!

Still if you're running into problems, feel free to come into our
chatroom. If you're not good at english, you may try italian or
french or spanish. The choice of languages available in our developer
room is steadily growing. Did I mention german?

1. Make sure you have a valid hostname
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    This is an issue for psyced installers no matter which platform you
    use. First you have to make sure that the IP number for your server
    reverse resolves to a hostname, no matter which. PSYC servers out there
    will want to ensure this hostname resolves forward to your IP address
    again. It's a question of necessary aggravated paranoia.  :)

    Luckily, if your ISP confronts you with dynamic IP address changes it
    normally also provides hostnames for those IPs, as ugly as they may look.
    If this is the case, you may still not have a static hostname which
    stays the same while your IP number keeps changing. Making one up will
    not help, PSYC servers out there will reject communication with you.

    That's not what you want. So even if you're just trying this out, to
    really be able to see what the PSYC internetworking gives you, install a
    dynamic DNS solution and put its name into the psyced configuration. We're
    not here to suggest any specific provider for dynamic DNS to you. Although
    they offer free service, many of them are commercial. Just search for the
    keywords "dynamic DNS" if you never heard of this. If you're an advanced
    hacker you can even set up a CNAME alias from your own domain to your new
    dynamic domain name, but you have to pay special attention to the TTL when
    you do.


2. Start using psyced
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    You may probably have gained some acquaintance with the technology
    on a user level simply by using existing public PSYC servers.
    Nonetheless you will however find enlightment in reading the
    user manual with all its commands. Some graphic clients may be
    mapping the commands into nice menues and buttons, but it sure
    is a good idea to be aware of how they work on the server side.

    If your web access is installed and by chance on port 44444
    you can use [4]http://localhost:44444/ to see the
    built-in webserver with its copy of the help pages. Otherwise
    the public copy resides at [5]http://help.pages.de.

    [6]http://psyced.org:33333/info/page?fmt=_help_operator&layout=PSYC
    shows the list of operator commands available to you if you configured
    yourself to be one. The same list should also be available on your
    own psyced at [7]http://localhost:44444/en/help/operator.page.

    One of the most popular actions once a psyced is in place is to
    customize your first own PSYC chatroom. For the documentation of how
    to go about that consult [8]http://about.psyc.eu/Create_place.


3. Installing a webchat applet
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The psyced comes with a simple and fast web applet which resides
    in "world/static" in its binary form. The source code is in "utility".
    In fact it should be ready to run right off the default website of
    psyced. If you're into Java(TM), feel free to enhance it and please
    share your improvements.  :-)


4. PSYC Networking
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    psyced allows you to send messages to remote PSYC entities using
    /m or /t psyc://whatever and to send presence announcements with
    /notify psyc://whatever. You can enter remote rooms with
    /go psyc://remote.host/@room and the other room commands.
    See the manual for details.


5. Keeping psyced up to date
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The release you have downloaded is supposed to be stable and well-behaving.
   A newer release from the website should have the same quality, only much
   better.  ;)

a) Update via Website

   Go to http://www.psyced.org/ or http://www.psyc.eu/
   and download the newest tarball.

b) Update via anonymous git

   psyced currently comes with a regular .git repository
   so you can use git commands to manage your version.
   If you're not familiar with git we have provided the
   basics as part of the psyced script:

   Please cd to your installation target directory
      (/opt/psyced, $HOME/psyced, /ve or whatever you chose)
   and execute bin/psyced -u.

   Your version of psyced will be updated. If there are any incompatibilities
   or a need for getting a new tarball, psyced -u will give you
   detailed information.


   Should you find yourself behind a firewall that doesn't let you use git
   protoocol,
   you can still help yourself by logging into an outside unix host using

        ssh -L 9418:git.psyced.org:9418

   Additionally you need to change the hostname to localhost in .git/config.

   By subscribing to psyc://psyced.org/@PSYC you will receive realtime
   notifications of patch submissions to the main git.


6. Tuning some details about psyced
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The following page documents some special settings of psyced.
        [9]http://about.psyc.eu/psyced


7. Where to go from here?
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Now that you have a psyced a lot of the things mentioned on about can
   be a place to start for your own exploration and extension. Pick any
   link for inspiration:
        [10]http://about.psyc.eu/Category:Application
        [11]http://about.psyc.eu/Category:Development
        [12]http://about.psyc.eu/Software
        [13]http://about.psyc.eu/Category:Solid


8. Interaction with other programs
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   chkrootkit is a very simplistic tool trying to find rootkits on your
   linux installation. Should you be running this, don't be surprised if
   it will complain about *any* IRC server running on port 6667. There
   are no attempts at all to figure out legitimacy. So ignore it, or use
   a different port number for your IRC server port.


8. Give feedback
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   So you're a successful new psycic! You even joined our chatroom, but
   now you'd like to put your thoughts somewhere less volatile. Well, we
   have this thing people call a wiki, because we like to reinvent things,
   but not on all occasions. The wiki is a welcome place for your thoughts -
   start out at http://about.psyc.eu, find the page that suits your topic,
   register a username (damn! no PSYC login integration yet!), edit it
   and throw in your thoughts. We like to prefix our thoughts with
   :<~~~>. Try it out and you'll see why. It's chat
   culture in our veins. Please use the "discussion" pages as the wiki has
   grown so much, it needs seperation of information from discussion to be
   useful.
