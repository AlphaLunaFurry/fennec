Fennec Den Gallery
==================

The Den Gallery is a Fennec Overlay module for asynchronous communications such as forums, 
podcast-like media feeds, email, artwork submission and subscription, group discussions, and more.

Fully integrated with Fennec Fyre and Fennec Litter, it focuses on asynchronous and threaded discussion, 
more serious and persistent than either Fennec Fyre or Fennec Moon.

Introduction
------------

Art communities such as DeviantArt, InkBunny, YouTube and others allow you to share content,
but do not protect basic liberties, and often abuse artists in unthinkable ways.

Art communties also tend to isolate and restrict both artists and their fans in ways
that are unforgivable.

For that reason, Fennec ships with a serverless distributed artwork sharing and gallery module.

This allows artists, musicians, cinematographers, game developers, performers and authors to
distribute their content for free, without any limits, and give their fans the ability to
promote their favorite songs, books, games and movies freely, while giving the originator
full credit for his or her cultural contribution to society, and providing easy means
to compensate the creators for their contributions.

When combined with Fennec Fire, Fennec Moon, Fennec Litter and Fennec Hunt, any cultural
contributer can easily distribute his or her content, easily promote him or herself, and
get compensated for his or her contributions.

Self publishing and earning commissions has never been easier!
