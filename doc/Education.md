Fire Mage is a mentoring and tutoring system build on top of the Fennec Overlay,

social network functionality and content distribution, respectively, to be able to share

Introduction
------------

Everyone with brains knows that formal education is not just a singularity of incompetence and
failure, but full of corruption and malice, with colleges and universities financially raping
students who trust them and rely on them for a future their parents never had, inflicting
debt, insanity, numerous abuses, and even rape and death upon the students who financially
support them.

For those precious few students who are financially aided with taxpayer money, the colleges
and universities commit even worse crimes against the students they are responsible for, 
wasting taxpayer money and destroying the lives of already destitute students on
research and tenure for worthless professors who should have been fired decades ago and forced
to search for a job like all of the students he has carelessly and thoughtlessly abused.

The formal education system will be destroyed, 
and starve to death in the dustbin of history.

This is why Fire Mage is so important. In order to render the formal education system irrelevent,
freelance teachers and professors need to be able to crowdfund research projects and large-scale
educational materials, tutorials and college courses.

Tutors, teachers and professors should be able to self-organize into student-owned or parent-owned
cooperative virtual schools or universities.

This balances out the abuses of unequal power by formal educational institutions 
and the evil people that enforce the system and monopoly on education and skill training.
