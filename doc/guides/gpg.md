Rewrite a massive comprehensive guide to the use of GPG email encryption with Thunderbird.


Fair Warning
============

There are known weaknesses to the rudimentary and naive approach to web-of-trust networks
as implemented in upstream Gnu Privacy Guard.

For GPG-related key management, it MAY be advisable to use RetroShare to manage and revoke
public keys, or announce changes in public keys.

As always, use your own discretion and judgement in these things.
