Write a comprehensive guide to smarter and more effective use of RetroShare, 
as well as clear and informative instructions on how to connect to
relay servers, introduction servers, and how to use RetroShare over
Tor and i2p.

Notice
------

Although RetroShare has vastly improved the last two years as of this
writing (May 2013), RetroShare has significant flaws, including
the lack of IPv6 support, forum and chat lobby moderation, and mobile and web client
availability.

Pidgin and Bitlbee plugin support is also absent, and the use of RetroShare over Tor
and i2p will require a code fork and significant modifications to RetroShare, 
and eventually a complete rewrite and refactoring, reimplementing the functionality
and protocol of RetroShare without the heisenbugs and bloated cludges.
