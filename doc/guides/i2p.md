Write a guide and handbook for I2P including how to operate eepsites safely, 
use I2Snark and Syndie, and how to comprehend the petname system and network
consensus.


Fair Warning
============

Although I2P is technically superior in many ways to the cruder approaches Tor takes,
The I2P network is relatively much smaller than the Tor network, 
and therefore takes a significant penalty in overall network strength, in terms of anonymity.

It would be nice if I2P were deployed all over, but I don't see an easy way to package it
with a killer app everone ever would download and run.
