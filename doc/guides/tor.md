====

Rewrite a huge comprehensive guide to effectively using Tor, as well as some pertinant information
about the weaknesses and compromises within the public Tor network, as well as instructions on
circumventing Tor weaknesses by using an independent Tor network to anonymize users from the
compromized public Tor network.

Notice
------

The public Tor network is confirmed and proven to be compromised and untrustworthy to access, even
for hidden services, without using the exit nodes.

For activism, anything relating to anarchy and tax resistance, or anything drug and carding related, 
DO NOT directly connect to the compromised public Tor network.

Your anomymity is illusary if you connect directly.

Use a secondary Tor network or another anonymizing proxy, 
such as a Bittorrent-friendly VPN.
