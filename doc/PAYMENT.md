Fennec Barter Foxcoin
==============

Fennec FoxCoin is an alternative blockchain cryptocurrency 
that uses a similar design to bitcoin or litecoin, 
while making tons of small adjustments, anonymity protections,
difficulty in interception, detection or interferance.

Introduction
------------

The primary weaknesses of Bitcoin revolve around 
how trivial tracing the origin of a transaction is, 
how vulnerable to attack it is, and 
how trivial it is to detect and intercept bitcoin traffic.

In this new design, we introduce Foxcoin, a new alternative
blockchain cryptocurrency which includes a ton of new features 
such as the ability to publish a lot more than simple transactions 
to the blockchain, such as smart contracts in many languages, 
the ability to use i2p-like DHT onion routing AND turtle routing 
to reach more peers than you normally would be able to.

The additional connectivity makes network consensus a lot more stable, 
encourages people to run many instances of the foxcoin daemon on
one device, and by including active foxcoin nodes and integration with
the other services Fennec provides, GUI context menus make it trivial
to tip anyone at any time, and make paying for favors trivial and
stupid simple.

Network Rules
-------------

Hashing algorythm used is SHA-3-512 (Keccak-512)
Difficulty is a block roughly every 30 seconds.
Keypairs are ECC by way of NaCl crypto.
Convention for confirmations should be 2 confirms.
