Fennec Fire Command
-------------------

Fire Command is distributed decisionmaking, collaborative policymaking, 
liquid or direct democracy, and/or open source collaborative lawmaking
built on top of the Fennec Overlay as a module.

Introduction
============

Gone are the days of omnipotent kings, ruling by divine right, waging petty wars 
against other divine kings while ignoring the suffering of the people they are
allegedly responsible for.

Democracy in its current form, with representation by career politicians, corporate
welfarism, lobbying by industry monopolies, and worse, while the average citizen
is utterly confident that his vote means absolutely nothing whatsoever.

With the two party system in America, and even worse corrupt systems of institutions
furiously defending their jobs and paychecks at the expense of taxpayers, or worse, 
using taxpayer money to harrass, imprison, violate the rights of, or even slay the
very taxpayers who support them, while doing nothing to protect the rights of the
people who entrusted them with the power and protection of institutions created
with the responsibility of earning those paychecks by providing essential services
to the people who gave them those jobs.

This WILL stop.

This is why Fennec Fire Command is important. By completely distributing decisionmaking, and
when combined with Fennec Litter Watch, Fennec Fire Light, Fennec Moon Song, Fennec Moon Chorus,
and other modules for the Fennec Overlay, governing ourselves was never easier.

The only way to eliminate tyrants is to destroy the concentration of power, and the centralization
of authority and responsibility.
