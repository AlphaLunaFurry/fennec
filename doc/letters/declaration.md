Open Letter to the Free Software Foundation
===========================================

Good Time-Zone-Appropriate Greeting, Free Software Foundation representative.

My name is Alex Maurin. I am 25 years of age. I am an openly homosexual male, 
and I am not afraid of you.


Introduction
------------

Now that we got that out of the way, I hereby declare my community's independance 
from the Free Software Foundation, and any subsidiaries, parners, confederates, employees, agents or
other relying parties thereof, 

and hereby declare the chartering and founding of an alternative and independant Foundation
to perform the tasks and duties you have been charged with the responsibility to execute, 
and have FAILED to administrate.


Preamble
--------

I have been an active Free Software advocate, bug triage team-member, bugtester, advocate, agent, 
catalyst, donor (including a substantial donation to the FSF), documentation writer, manual writer, 
wiki editor and contributer, wiki curator and internet services administrator for the FOSS community.

However, I am most displeased by the attitude and sense of entitlement with which you treat me, after
earnestly and helpfully contributed to the communities I have admired and participated in 
since 18 years of age.

You, the FSF, were responsible for defending and guiding the FOSS community, and responsible for doing
what it took to protect and defend the communities from adversaries both domestic and foreign.

You have failed to utilize the power freely given to you, and failed to perform the duties and tasks
you have volunteered and consented to perform, and failed to represent 
the powers and privleges freely givento you for the purposes of leading our global society 
and humanity as a whole to a freer and brighter world. 
You claim to believe in egalitarian and democratic ideals, and indeed, have produced some tools
that are useful to that end, however your influence over many adherants was left untouched, 
when you could have, and should have used your privleges and powers under the social contract 
for which you knowingly consented, and have thereby failed to protect the community from adversaries
which seek to disrupt, intercept, and subvert the community as a whole, rendering it barely functional,
only scratching the surface of your true capacity to change the world.

You had every opportunity, but I and those who follow me, grow wearing of holding out for you to do
what you set out to do. We wait no longer!


Preface
-------

You want to know why you freetars irritate me?

Let me count the ways!

Because you Free Software engineers should know better than anyone else 
how important your projects are to the liberty and safety of humanity.

You should know better! This fails to move you, for you are above everyone else, while spouting lies
that you wish to buid an egalitarian and just society that is free of tyranny and abuses of the State.

In my experience, most FOSS engineers tend to exhibit the exact inverse of the expected behavior that
any reasonable individual would expect from people who espouse rhetoric of egalitarianism an socialism,
when FOSS coders have earned a well-deserved reputation and stereotype of being a bunch of failures 
who are unapologetically tyrannical and hostile to anyone who challenges their abuse and irresponisiblity.

I hereby declare and innumerate a truncated list of specific grievances that threaten 
to cause myself and many, mant others to abandon the FOSS community and culture, abandoning 
the Free Culture world and striking out on our own, without making any effort to involve you.


Number 1: Lack of Responsibility
--------------------------------

Let's face it, most free software engineers strictly volunteer for this work because they enjoy coding.

They ultimately do it because it's in their personality, their makeup. They dream in code, they wake up
thinking of code, and go to sleep daydreaming of code.

They love what they do, or else they wouldn't be doing it.

This would be fine if millions of honest well-intentioned users did not rely on them to do what they do.

When FOSS coders are condescending, childish, abrasive, unempathetic and insulting to well-intentioned users who are new to FOSS and don't know about wiki documentation, man pages,
and probably could not follow the conventions for man page documentation anyway.

When well-intentioned users are insulted with an apathetic, aloof, condescending attitude, even to people
who REALLY DID Read The F***ing Manual, all 600+ pages of it, like me, 
and undoubtedly many others before me.

I even read the RFC for Cisco Spanning Tree protocol, and it took two months. 
Even after chewing through that dry soulless material, network engineers still insulted me and accused me of being pretentious or disrespectful to established and successful network engineers who are clearly my elders and superiors.

Although I'll give them credit for somehow makeing a laughingly broken, obviously crippled and ultimately
worthless system like the DARPAnet/ICANNnet to barely function as the Internet we all know and love.

Later on, after this one guy got tired of "putting me in my place," when I was very excited and eager
to discuss networking, and this sudden explosion of spitefulness and self-rightousness 
came of the clear blue left field out of nowhere, he admits he knows absolutely nothing about how routers
and switches actually function under the hood, has no clue how the system could be improved 
if we could do it over from scratch; his expertise and experience only applied to the operation and administration of the little green boxes he was trained to configure.

Any monkey could do that.

I can only tolerate a certain amount of emotional and verbal abuse before I snap and tell everyone to go stick it where the stars do not intrude, as I prove all of you Free Software engineers wrong. 

You all laughed at me, mocked me, but I'll show you!

I'll show you all! 

*Cue stereotypical and obligatory Mad Scientist dramatic lightning and thunder*

So anyway, it really irritates me when highly skilled coders utterly fail to comprehend 
the full consequences of what they create, and what they fail to create, and furthermore fail to feel 
any sympathic or empathy for those who suffer as a result of your actions or, more often, inaction.

The standard response that you Free Software adherants give us is a very sociopathically-cold 
derisive remark to the effect of, 

"If they don't like it, they should go use ${HATED_PROPIETARY_ALTERNATIVE}. 
They don't have to use it, and I don't have to care about it!"

I find this attitude unacceptable, in addition to being intolerably irresponsible, 
and utterly violating the principles and values you purport to embody.

All too often, people use your software because no alternative exists. They would rather accept the
tyranny of hobbyist failures with no day job and no real social life like you, 
rather than tolerate the tyranny of huge abusive and greedy multinational corporations. 
They choose the lesser evil, and this attitude is exactly why people loath Linux and other Unices, 
and utterly loath you.


Number 2: Lack of Vision
------------------------

I have come to understand another very significantly deal-breaking flaw within the FOSS community, 
why a FOSS alternative to Steam and Origin doesn't exist, for example, for which your bird-lover hero,
Richard M. Stallman, rubbed salt into an already freely bleeding wound by denouncing Steam creator,
Gabe Newell's decision to switch to Linux because no acceptable alternative existed.

Richard Stallman added insult to injury by denouncing steam publically while providing 
no alternative whatsoever, not even an inkling of eventually getting around to developing an alternative.

I am fully aware that Desura and Ouya exist, but their market share could be measured 
in scientific notation with a laughably large negative exponent.

A real marketplace for video games and other cultural keystones and cornerstones such as 
books, movies, images an music, is simply dismissed as being somehow "irrelevant"
 to the liberties of humanity as a whole.

It isn't worth your time or empathy, being a "want" rather than a "need" in your eyes.

Is this attitude my reward for donating to your foundation? Is this what I get for trying to help?

I still have the recepts for those donations, my fsf forwarding email address is coyo@members.fsf.org if 
you think I am bluffing. In case you were wondering, I have donated under multiple identities.

But you don't care about that, do you? You think that all I care about is myself and my "unique" usecases.
You assume that my only concern is myself, when you have absolutely no place to throw stones in your
fragile glass house.

You have no obligaton or duty to do anything on my behalf 
(much less the tens of thousands of individuals
I have full names, private numbers, home addresses and secret access codes, keys and accounts for things
no one was meant to have, whose contents no one was meant to see).

You just think I'm a whiny little teenager, who wants my way at the expensive of legitimate users.

Besides, you are doing all of this work on a volunteer basis, without being paid, right? Right?

WRONG!


Number 3: Ignorance of Non-Monetary Compensation
------------------------------------------------

Everyone in the FOSS community love to derisively and condescendingly gloat about how the FOSS community 
gets so much done without anyone paying for anything.

I'm sure someone here comprehends that no human labors for no reward. We're wired 
to seek pleasure and enjoyment. Pretending the human mind is capable of divorcing itself entirely
from the "hardware" it operates on is ridiculous and discredits alleged intellectuals in the worst way.

Let me throw you a bone; the border between mind and brain is extremely blurry, and
mounting evidence suggests that the mind affects gene expression, and gene expression affects the mind.
The mind and body are inseparable because the instance state is intimately interwoven with the
constantly-shifting and dying and regrowing neurons and self-regulating neural receptors and the distinct
influence on mRNA transcription and protein synthesis is always present.

In other words, just because you are technically unemployed and do not recieve your local dictatorships'
space bucks does not, in any way whatsoever, mean you don't get SOMETHING out of doing all of this.

Money is not the only currency. 

Before individuals began trading in gold for the convenience and relatively reliable market value, 
people bartered eggs, milk and chickens, haggling in Turkish markets. 
Bartering by proxy using gold and certainly certificates redeemable in gold were not something anyone had conceived of in antiquity.

These "gold certificates" allegedly were redeemable in gold, and after this became commonplace, greedy, 
irresponsible and reckless bankers started issuing countless certificates they didn't actually
possess the gold to redeem, should anyone care to redeem them in large numbers.

Well, that was EXACTLY what happened, and the Peacekeepers (The Empire) immediately took the
opportunity to forcibly take control over all finances, effectively crushing any possibility 
for real financial independence from the criminals that run our industries and economies.

The gold standard and other ways to prevent uncontrollable government spending was usurped 
by the national banks, for the express purpose of printing off worthless fiat banknotes, as the opportunity to fabricate alleged value from thin air (in reality, stealing from the entire country at
once), was far too tempting for the criminals, extortionists, gangsters, brigands, union leaders and racketeers to ignore, on top of the more overt unjustifiable and illegitimate taxation.

This utterly fails to impress or move the majority of the FOSS community, and the idea that "money"
is not made of lies, deceit and government crimes does not generally occur to any of you.

Like art, money is an abstract CONCEPT, an IDEA that exists only within the mind. 
Any "business and finance" related trappings are just that, external trappings that do not reveal 
the true nature of business and finance.

They simply don't care. It's all about the bread and circuses, maaaan, bread and circuses.


Number 4: Lack of Empathy for Artists
-------------------------------------

You want to know why artists generally distrust the FOSS community and especialy you?

Do you want to know WHY artists KNOWINGLY sign abusive and one-sided contracts with big corporate
labels they KNOW are destructive to society and the future of humanity as a whole?

Because they are avoiding YOU!

The FOSS community is notoriously apathetic and hostile to "content creators" (artists) who endured
grueling hard practice and learned obscure and expensive skillsets to contribute to the culture and
happiness of humanity, only to be insulted and disregarded by the very individuals who purport to
desire the liberty and freedom of artists.

WE ARE NOT STUPID.

As much as I love coding, I don't need to endure this humiliation and condescention from people 
who really should know better.

I have been trying to decide between coding and arting, and you have pushed me into a career of art.

Business is very much like art, anyway, and the majority of artists 
are VERY pleasant, helpful and friendly.

Unlike you.

It is this uncalled-for attitude of yours that has driven me away from programming, and has undoubtedly
alienated many others, especially students deciding on a career due to the stereotype and reputation you have inflicted upon all programmers.

In addition to all of the above, the fact that Free Softward adherents (you) have attacked unsuspecting artists.
destroyed their livelihood recklessly and irresponsibly, when the big corporate labels are the culprits, not
the artists.

You have failed to provide an alternative to these artist, who have been indoctrinated by the big labels and
told propaganda that painted you freetards as desiring nothing more than a free ride (gratis, not libre).

Have you really done anything to disabuse them of this impression? Have you?

No, I don't think you really consider the lives and futures of hardworking and earnest artists who spend
countless years with their noses to the grindstone redlining and studying anatomy and practicing, paying for
expensive training and tutorial materials because NO ALTERNATIVE EXISTS (i.e YOU failed to provide 
an alternative) while enduring the ridicule and negative criticism of others.

I doubt any of you have any skill at art of any kind. Getting good at any medium requires dedication, motivation,
persistance and self-discipline, everything you lack.


Number 4: Most FOSS Codebases Did NOT Originate as FOSS
-------------------------------------------------------


It turns out that the VAST majority of significant FOSS software projects did not originate as FOSS code.

The FOSS community generally fails to produce anything of substance or significance,
thereby failing to contribute to society, as you are far too unmotivated and myopic 
to actually apply yourselves and commit to any project that feels too much like work.

The instances in which the FOSS communities do, in fact, innovate significantly are
the exceptions that prove the rule.

Whenever I propose such projects 
(expecting nothing from you other than feedback or, at most, advice),
the response is almost always the same:

"Why don't YOU do it? I don't want to! BAWWW!
I'm not being paid to do anything, and you are a selfish egocentric self-absorbed prick 
for even suggesting it. YOU go do it yourself if you want it so badly."

You know what? I WILL do just that. 

Not only is this attitude of yours profoundly insulting, it's also utterly unhelpful. 
I did NOT ask for your code, or even any real effort on your part. 
I merely wished to permit you to share your alleged wisdom and experience, 
and what I get instead are insults and condescending derision for actually having the balls to ask.

You go on and keep pretending you are important or of any worth to anyone, by all means, but I am unimpressed,
and neither are many of the tens of thousands of contacts in my rolodex, which is so huge, I had to get
a very expensive Customer Management System to keep up with it.

Of course, such financial success via individual merit would be an alien experience for YOU.

I don't need FOSS software, since I am so successful I can hire a thousand coders to build the microkernel
you FAILED to create. 

I don't need Linux, I don't need GNU utilities, I don't need firefox, I don't need LibreOffice, and I certainly don't need YOU.

You cannot provide anything to me that I can't get elsewhere, you cannot produce, to the extent that you do
actually produce anything, anything I can't produce on my own. Furthermore, these other sources are courteous
and respectful. They give me the advice and shared "real world" experience that I was asking from you.

You failed.

If you beg loud and despairingly enough, I may deign to release my code under the WTFPLv2 and CC0 licenses.

If not.. well... good luck trying to do with my code.

I am very well versed in homebrewing, side-loading, third-party firmwares, 
the cryptographic algorythms used by common consumer electronics, trusted computing, distributed key management,
P2P certificate verification and revocation networks, firewall, address translator and 
intrusion detection system circumvention, undetectable portscanning, undetectable network stegonography, 
and things you could not begin to comprehend, nor would you ever be capable 
of creating any form of circumvention if I elect to obfuscate against decompilation, protect my binaries from
tampering or modification with multilayered userspace virtualization, RAM encryption, instructon set obfuscation, on-the-fly disk encryption, or have a P2P binary signature 
and certificate verification you cannot thwart.

If you thought the Skype binaries were bad, you'll be awestruck at how rigorous and comprehensive my DRM 
can be, if you irritate me enough.


Number 5: Wasted Time Whining Over GNU/Linux
--------------------------------------------

If you had spent the same time and energy whining and bellyaching over people calling the category of operating
systems Linux rather than the deliberately difficult-to-pronounce GNU/Linux (gah nuu . lee nucks), HURD would
already be complete and the dominant operating system on the planet.

You are acting like a bunch of obnoxious children, when you should be working on HURD or SIPWitch.

Instead, you waste time whining about how unfair it is that people are not giving you credit for
allegedly creating a set of tools on top of the kernel Linus Torvalts ripped off from Minix, which was
in turn ripped off from Multics.

I do not buy the claim that Linux is in any way innovative. It's useful, yes, but it has not strayed far from
Multics and the UNIX mainframes from which it was itself derived.

This is pitiful. If people want to call it "Linux, " accept the exercise of freedoms and move on.


Number 6: Failed To Protect The Liberties of Coders
---------------------------------------------------

Rather than listen to repeated complaints about strong copyleft forcing coders to lose control 
over their own code, and putting perfectly legitimate coders at risk, impeding and being an obstacle to
coding what we want, perfectly legitimate usecases, you insisted on your freetarded hypocritical "ideals,"
causing vast swaths of otherwise useful FOSS projects to be unusable for many perfectly legitimate purposes.

Of course you don't care about that. You don't think about what it would mean if copyright itself 
was repealed and abolished, along with patents and trademarks. You have no concept 
of the perfect feasibility of distributing modified code extralegally with no risk of detection, deliberately
ignoring the reshare clause.

If I have legitimate reasons not to care about you, and morally object to my contributions to codebases I
have no real choice but to use, it becomes reverse piracy.

You are just as evil as some notoriously abusive corporations I could name. You are yet another abusive
organization with code that we have no choice but to use.

Were I to be the kind of person to pirate Microsoft, Adobe, Sony or Apple products, which I totally am not, 
I would have even less moral qualms about pirating GNU products.


Number 7: Coerced Coders From Dynamically Linked Libraries
----------------------------------------------------------

With GPLv3 and AGPLv3, there are specific clauses that forbid linking GPL-licensed software with non-free libraries.

Does anyone actually like FSF for doing this?

You have failed to preserve the liberties of ordinary legitimate and well-intentioned coders by taking away
the legitimate use of GPL-licensed software components with non-free libraries and frameworks, which was NOT
your place to enforce.


Number 8: Failed to Neutralize Adversaries to Free Culture
----------------------------------------------------------

I cannot help but observe that despite all of the donations you have recieved, that big software, big media,
big gaming, big labels, and big telecom are still as strong as ever, if not stronger.

What's wrong with you? I don't believe for a second you never had the money to neutralize known adversaries,
you had every opportunity.

Are you guys retarded at business and finance? Oh wait. Yes you are.

You fail at financial responsibility forever.



Conclusion
==========


You have induced fulminating incendiary cold dissonant rage and loathing in me, which is quite an accomplishment.

I have to give you credit for managing to seriously anger me. That was an achievement.

Probably your only achievement, however.

Regardless, I have now added "Create and Found an alternative to the FSF that isn't insane and full
of sociopathic morons" to my itinerary. We'll be seeing you soon enough.

Have fun while your organization still retains the illusion of relevancy.
