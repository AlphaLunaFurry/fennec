Some Notes on Fennec Link
=========================

Fennec Link is a high-performance layer 2 protocol. It does not directly protect anonymity, but
does encrypt end-to-end at the network interface device level.


Introduction
------------

Fennec aims to virtualize and converge all communications, connecting your device's system bus 
directly to that of those you care about, creating a huge virtual machine that can scale
to a global intercontinental footprint.

In other words, Fennec is similar to a combination of Juniper QFabric, Cray Gemini Interconnect, 
and even more experimental and innovative forms of crossbar optical fabric switching 
generally used in multiprocessor interconnects and mutlichassis switching fabrics.


How It Works
------------

Generally speaking, the design is essentially an omega clos hypercube network with 
linear network coding and flit wormhole switching.

It resembles the general concept of the Distributed Supercomputer Supernet (SSN) but takes it even further.

Fennec uses a combination of modified chip-level label switching and Kademlia routing 
to achieve perfect decentralization while maintaining realtime speeds very close to wirespeed. 
Fennec is intended to make traffic interception and inspection exceedingly difficult 
for any parties other than those communicating.

Design and interim code originated from CJDNS, I2P, RetroShare, SecureShare, BitTorrent Chat and others.

The Fennec Link layer-2 protocol stack seeks to solve hard problems 
with the fundemental failures and critical flaws in the current Internet architecture and infrastructure.

Insight and ideas have originated from places as diverse as HackBB, Open Cobalt, gnuNET, AnoNet, 
Hyperboria, PSYCed, SwiftIM, OpenSourceSkype, BATMAN, B4RN, Asterisk, FON, Tomato, GNS3 and FreedomBox, 
it seeks to cherrypick the best concepts and ideas of each, and synthesize a new and cohesive whole.

This is going to be awesome!
