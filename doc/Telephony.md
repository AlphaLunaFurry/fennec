----------------

Moon Howl is voice and video telephony built on top of the Fennec Overlay
as a module extending the general instant messaging provided by Fennec Moon.

Introduction
============

As everyone knows, the telephone companies and other incumbent telephony providers, 
including mobile carriers, are all wildly abusive toward their customers, especially
in America, where subscribers are almost always overcharged for substandard service.

This doesn't include all of the nickel and diming they inflict upon their customers, 
forcing their subscribers to pay hidden fees, roaming, and other unnecessary and
deceptive charges for standard and expected functionality that costs the provider
almost nothing to provide.

This must stop.

Moon Howl provides a real and full-featured alternative to Skype, SIP and the PSTN,
providing a pure P2P model for free telephony while sacrificing no features whatsoever.
