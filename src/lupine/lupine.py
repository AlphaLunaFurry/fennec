# an automated autoconfiguration script that acts as an independent library from fennec.

# this script will eventually be packaged as a seperate project as a network-negotiation
# library that other projects can use for orchestrated upnp, pwnat, ice and many other methods
# that can be trivially used to provided nearly-guaranteed capacity to accept incoming connections 
# from any software that also uses lupine.

# named after wolves because lupine attempts to encourage the solidarity of a wolf pack between
# services exposed by way of lupine. In addition, wolves are awesome.
